# GeneralMathsMOD Mirror Links

## IMPORTANT NOTE
If a link gets blocked, make me know with an issue. I will put a `Maybe BLOCKED` text close to the corresponding link. Links will be only from my own deploys. I will put each mirror link I create for the community ðŸ˜‰
Also, if links end in `repl.co` and they give the error `This repl is very popular` means that there are many people using it at the same time.
As well, replit Mirror links will be rarely updated (whenever I have time of doing so.)
